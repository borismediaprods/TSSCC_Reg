# TSSCC_Reg

Piece of software that Thornhill Secondary School Computer Club will use to register students for the upcoming 2015-2016 year.
In order for this to work, you must install Java Mail API (it's free, I think?).

You enter an address, it instantly sends an e-mail there with any message. When you're done sending out e-mails, you enter
your own secret e-mail and it will send you the list of everyone who registered (their e-mail addresses, so you can keep track of who
registered).

Also, I prevented it from having duplicates or fake addresses. The fake-check is really bad, but it works for 60% of cases where people
are too lasy to put the '@' sign.
